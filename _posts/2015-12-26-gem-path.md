Suppose we want to discover where a `gem` is in our system. We can use the
`find` command, or maybe `locate` depending on which system you have. But there
are easier ways to do it.

Let's see the first way:

```ruby
$ gem list -d redcarpet

*** LOCAL GEMS ***

redcarpet (3.1.2)
    Authors: Natacha Porté, Vicent Martí
    Homepage: http://github.com/vmg/redcarpet
    License: MIT
    Installed at: <path/in/your/machine>

    Markdown that smells nice
```
This command will display some useful information, including the path where the
gem was installed.

If we just want to display the path we can use:

```ruby
$ EDITOR=echo gem open redcarpet
<path/in/your/machine>
```
